# Detecting-and-analysis-of-fraudulent-transactions-in-the-financial-sector

This project investigates the problem of detecting financial fraud using machine learning methods. The focus is on developing models for the immediate identification of suspicious transactions. Special attention is given to the use of classical models such as Xgboost, K-neighbors, Random Forest, and others, as well as autoencoders for analyzing multidimensional data. The work also includes the creation of an API that allows the integration of developed models into banking systems. The results demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed solutions in identifying fraudulent operations.

## Key words:
Financial fraud, fraud detection, machine learning, Xgboost, autoencoder, neural networks, API creation.
